	"description" : "Time of Day is a mod which gradually advances the time inside the heist as the heist goes on. For example, you may go into the safehouse and it will be night-time, after about 20 minutes it will be day-time. It achieves this through the use of Beardlib which allows it to easily modify the values of the game's environment.",
